I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about me. Honestly, I have nothing to say much about myself. Now, I only know that learning and hard-working and love are things I truly believe in. Without love, there will be nothing, there will only war, conflict and death. Without learning, you will always be blined by Yourself. Ironically, "ignorance is bliss"". Without hard-working, you will drown yourself with laziness, depression and confusion of your truth identity
